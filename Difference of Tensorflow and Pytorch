# Difference of Tensorflow and Pytorch

## 1. the paradigm to implement deep-learning
* Framework: A program that provides manual rules and various elements necessary for development

• Tensorflow: Define-and-Run framework
Create a session that is an environment in which code is directly turned.
It declares placeholder and then make a calculate graph and create a calculation graph. Then put the data at the time of code execution.
• Pytorch: Define-by-Run framework
Put the data at the time of declaration and it doesn't need session so code is simple and the difficulty level is low.
